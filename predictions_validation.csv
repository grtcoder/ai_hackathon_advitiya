During this process, there are material conversions in the wort, the conversion products of which are undesirable in part. Such products must be expelled with the steam escaping from the wort in an evaporation device. The conventional evaporation devices have a vessel with a cylindrical wall part. The wort is sprayed against the inner side thereof and runs thereon at an accelerated rate downward to an outlet opening. Thereby the residence time of the wort is relatively short. 2.2. In the wort evaporation device according to the invention, the wall part (11) onto which the wort is applied is formed as a hollow truncated cone, which opens towards the top and the lower end of which forms the outlet opening (14) for the wort.
